Inheritance:
Creating a new class by making use of an existing class
Syntax:
class child-child-class-name(or)derived class name(p1,p2,...pn):
        class body
p1=parent class 1
p2=parent class 2
.
.
.
pn=parent class n
There are 5 types of Inheritance:
1. Single level Inheritance --> parent to child(A->B)
2. Multilevel Inheritance --> parent to child and the child act as a parent to another child class(A->B->C)
3. Multiple Inheritance --> Having more than one parent class to child class(A->C;B->C)
4. Hierarchical Inheritance --> Deriving more than one child classes to a single parent class(A->B,C,D)
5. Hybrid Inheritance --> Combination of any two types of inheritances (A->B,D,C->E)
Super Function:It inherits properties and methods of parent class
FILE HANDLING
-------------:
                 A file is a place on the disk.
                 There are two types of files:
                                             a. Text File
                                             b. Binary File
                 Advantages:
                 -----------
                            1. Creating or opening a file
                            2. Read/Write operation on the file
                            3. Closing the file
                 open():
                 ------
                        syntax: fileptr object=open("filename","mode")
                        1. The open() is used for creating a new file and as well as is used for opening a file already present in the system.
                        2. When the mode specified is 'w' and if the file is already present then that file data get losses.
                        3. When the mode specified is 'w' and if the file is not present then that file data get creates.
                 mode:
                 -----
                        The mode specifies the intention of the user in opening the file
                        r-read mode
                        w-write mode
                        a-append mode
                        b-binary mode
                 close():
                 ---------
                           syntax: fileptrobject.close()
                           It breaks the connection from the file
                 write():
                 ---------
                           syntax: fileptr
